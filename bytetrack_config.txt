# ByteTrack Tracker Configuration for Ultralytics YOLO
# Optimized for people counting in RTSP streams

# Tracker type
tracker_type: bytetrack

# Detection confidence thresholds
track_high_thresh: 0.5      # High confidence threshold for starting new tracks
track_low_thresh: 0.1       # Low confidence threshold for maintaining existing tracks
new_track_thresh: 0.6       # Confidence threshold for creating new tracks

# Track management
track_buffer: 30            # Number of frames to keep lost tracks alive
match_thresh: 0.8           # IoU threshold for matching detections to tracks

# Frame rate (adjust based on your RTSP stream)
frame_rate: 30              # Expected frame rate for temporal calculations

# Distance metric
proximity_thresh: 0.5       # Threshold for spatial proximity
appearance_thresh: 0.25     # Threshold for appearance similarity (if using ReID)

# Additional parameters
min_box_area: 100          # Minimum bounding box area (pixels²)
aspect_ratio_thresh: 1.6    # Maximum aspect ratio for person detections
